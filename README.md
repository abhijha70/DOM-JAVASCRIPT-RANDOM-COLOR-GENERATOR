 HEY there! i created a basic javascript random color generator by using Vanilla HTML, Vanilla CSS, Vanilla JAVASCRIPT   
 
# HTML FILE / color html
In this file you can see i created a div,  in div there is div class of cantainer also in div there is h2 element in thhis element there is some text with testing name also in div there is button with the id of btn which says CLICK ME which we use later.

# color.css 
//in css i used *(which represents global body of css) use some styling to reset everything then.
//after that i imported a font called Lato from google fonts.
//after that in body i used transition of 2 seceonds that's why it changing color after 2 seconds when you click on click me button.
//then in main class which represnts div i give it height,width 100% so my div's height & width would throughput page (you don"t have to scroll it)
